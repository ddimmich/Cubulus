"""PersistentDB - persistent DB-API 2 connections.

Implements steady, thread-affine persistent connections to a database
based on an arbitrary DB-API 2 compliant database interface module.

This should result in a speedup for persistent applications such as the
application server of "Webware for Python," without loss of robustness.

Robustness is provided by using "hardened" SteadyDB connections.
Even if the underlying database is restarted and all connections
are lost, they will be automatically and transparently reopened.

Measures are taken to make the database connections thread-affine.
This means the same thread always uses the same cached connection,
and no other thread will use it. So even if the underlying DB-API module
is not thread-safe at the connection level this will be no problem here.

For best performance, the application server should keep threads persistent.
For this, you have to set MinServerThreads = MaxServerThreads in Webware.

For the Python DB-API 2 specification, see:
	http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0249.html
For information on Webware for Python, see:
	http://www.webwareforpython.org


Usage:

First you need to set up a generator for your kind of database connections
by creating an instance of PersistentDB, passing the following parameters:

	dbapi: the DB-API 2 compliant database module to be used
	maxusage: the maximum number of reuses of a single connection
		(the default of 0 or False means unlimited reuse)
		Whenever the limit is reached, the connection will be reset.
	setsession: an optional list of SQL commands that may serve to
		prepare the session, e.g. ["set datestyle to german", ...].

	Additionally, you have to pass the parameters for the actual
	database connection which are passed via the DB-API 2 module,
	such as the names of the host, database, user, password etc.

For instance, if you are using pgdb as your DB-API 2 database module and want
every connection to your local database 'mydb' to be reused 1000 times:

	import pgdb # import used DB-API 2 module
	from PersistentDB import PersistentDB
	persist = PersistentDB(pgdb, 1000, database='mydb')

Once you have set up the generator with these parameters, you can
request database connections of that kind:

	db = persist.connection()

You can use these connections just as if they were ordinary
DB-API 2 connections. Actually what you get is the hardened
SteadyDB version of the underlying DB-API 2 connection.

Closing a persistent connection with db.close() will be silently
ignored since it would be reopened at the next usage anyway and
contrary to the intent of having persistent connections. Instead,
the connection will be automatically closed when the thread dies.
You can change this behavior be setting persist._closeable to True.


Requirements:

Minimum requirement: Python 2.2. Recommended: Python 2.4.3.


Ideas for improvement:

* Add thread for monitoring and restarting bad or expired connections
  (similar to DBConnectionPool/ResourcePool by Warren Smith).
* Optionally log usage, bad connections and exceeding of limits.
